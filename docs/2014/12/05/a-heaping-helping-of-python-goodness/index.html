<p>I really enjoy solving problems quickly and thoroughly. I especially enjoy solving annoying, repetitive problems that invite human error. The icing on the cake is when I learn some new tricks in the process. This last few days was a flurry of problem-solving and trick-learning.</p>

<p>My favorite tricks are small bits of learning that make code easier to write, read and use. A couple of these are Windows-specific but most are general.</p>

<h2 id="1-turn-a-python-program-into-a-windows-batch-file">1. Turn a Python Program into a Windows Batch File</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m lazy and I don&rsquo;t like typing more than I have to. Even better is to just double-click on a thing from the Windows Explorer. I&rsquo;ve tried doing this with Windows .BAT files in the past but it was ugly and I always had to fiddle around with it, so when I found a universal solution on the Internet I was quite pleased. So far, putting the first line at the top of a batch file has worked everywhere I&rsquo;ve tried it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@setlocal enabledelayedexpansion &amp;&amp; python -x &quot;%~f0&quot; %* &amp; exit /b !ERRORLEVEL!
#start python code here (tested on Python 2.7.4)
</code></pre>

<p>It has the additional benefit that generic scripts are easily adaptable for non-Windows machines &mdash; just take out the first line.</p>

<h2 id="2-with-and-the-context-manager">2. <code>with</code> and the Context Manager</h2>

<p>The <strong>with</strong> keyword has been in Python for awhile now; the simplest way of thinking about it is that it sets up a <strong>try-finally</strong> block for you. One of the things I love most about Python is that the language designers pay attention to the little things that people do over and over and think &ldquo;hey, maybe we can make this better!&rdquo; So sure, you can write your own <strong>try-finally</strong> blocks to do this, but if it gets too messy you won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Here, I just wanted to visit a directory, do something, and come back. I found myself doing this in numerous places in the program, so to prevent errors and make the code clearer, I decided to try to do the repetitive activity in one place.</p>

<p>You can write your own context manager class, but in many cases you can do it much more simply using the <strong>contextmanager</strong> decorator on a function. The <strong>yield</strong> in the middle of the function is where you&rsquo;d normally have all your actions in the <strong>try</strong> block, and the code after the <strong>yield</strong> is what would happen in the <strong>finally</strong> block:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import os
from glob import glob
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def visitDir(d):
    old = os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(d)
    yield d
    os.chdir(old)

paths = [os.path.join('.', p[0:-1]) for p in glob('*/')]

for p in paths:
    with visitDir(p):
        print p + &quot;: &quot;
        for f in glob('*'):
            print &quot;   &quot;, f
</code></pre>

<p>The program just visits each directory one level down from the current one and prints the contents. Notice that <strong>old</strong> is held through the <strong>yield</strong> and used to restore the old directory.</p>

<p>Because of the simplicity of the <strong>contextmanager</strong> decorator, I&rsquo;m going to be using <strong>with</strong> statements a lot more now.</p>

<h2 id="3-command-line-arguments-with-argparse">3. Command-line Arguments with <code>argparse</code></h2>

<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve tried to use <strong>optparse</strong> but it always ended up feeling too messy and complicated, so I&rsquo;d just punt and pick the arguments off the command line myself. Apparently powers that be observed this happening enough that someone decided to create a simpler, better command-line parsing module. I finally reached for <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/argparse/">argparse</a> this week, and I&rsquo;m now a convert &mdash; argument parsing has become easy, and I won&rsquo;t hesitate to put it into future programs.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple example that only uses optional flags, which can come in a single-hyphen short form or a double-hyphen long form:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument(&quot;-r&quot;, &quot;--run&quot;, action='store_true',
    help=&quot;Run all the scala scripts and capture any errors&quot;)
parser.add_argument(&quot;-s&quot;, &quot;--simplify&quot;, action='store_true',
    help=&quot;Remove unimportant trace files &amp; show non-empty error files&quot;)
parser.add_argument(&quot;-c&quot;, &quot;--clean&quot;, action='store_true',
    help=&quot;Remove all 'run' artifacts&quot;)
parser.add_argument(&quot;-p&quot;, &quot;--prerequisites&quot;, action='store_true',
    help=&quot;Compile prerequisites&quot;)
parser.add_argument(&quot;-u&quot;, &quot;--unusedfiles&quot;, action='store_true',
    help=&quot;Display non 'Solution-' and non 'Starter-' scala files&quot;)
parser.add_argument(&quot;-t&quot;, &quot;--test&quot;, action='store_true',
    help=&quot;Test&quot;)
args = parser.parse_args()

if not any(vars(args).values()): parser.print_help()
if args.test:
    print &quot;test&quot;
if args.clean:
    print &quot;clean&quot;
if args.prerequisites:
    print &quot;prerequisites&quot;
if args.run:
    print &quot;run&quot;
if args.simplify:
    print &quot;simplify&quot;
if args.unusedfiles:
    print &quot;unusedfiles&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a dash or double-dash in front of an argument, that argument is automatically optional. The default is that arguments can be in any order. It&rsquo;s also possible to have argument parameters and pretty much any other configuration you need; see the above link for details.</p>

<p>You create an <strong>ArgumentParser</strong>, then add arguments. Note that I use both the short and long form of arguments, followed by <strong>action=&lsquo;store_true&rsquo;</strong> which puts a Boolean in that argument&rsquo;s location when it finds the flag. Then you can just perform tests such as <strong>if args.clean</strong> in your code.</p>

<p>The <strong>help</strong> text is displayed when you ask for help with the flag <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>&ndash;help</strong>, and I&rsquo;ve also explicitly called <strong>parser.print_help()</strong> if no flags at all are present; that way if you just run the command you get the help text:</p>

<pre><code>c:\tmp&gt;python argparse-example.py -t -u -r
test
run
unusedfiles

c:\tmp&gt;python argparse-example.py
usage: argparse-example.py [-h] [-r] [-s] [-c] [-p] [-u] [-t]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -r, --run            Run all the scala scripts and capture any errors
  -s, --simplify       Remove unimportant trace files &amp; show non-empty error
                       files
  -c, --clean          Remove all 'run' artifacts
  -p, --prerequisites  Compile prerequisites
  -u, --unusedfiles    Display non 'Solution-' and non 'Starter-' scala files
  -t, --test           Test
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that the arguments make this look like a kind of build program, which it is. I seem to reinvent <strong>make</strong>-like build tools on a regular basis, but <strong>argparse</strong> has me thinking that, with enough built-in tools like Python provides, I might not need a build framework &mdash; perhaps all I need to do is use the tools to create a custom builder for each need.</p>

<h2 id="4-creating-standalone-executables-with-pyinstaller">4. Creating Standalone Executables with PyInstaller</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another problem that I&rsquo;ve poked at for years &mdash; well, looked at and decided it was too much trouble. And this week, discovered that someone has made it easy with <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki">PyInstaller</a>.</p>

<p>My friend James Ward asked me to help him create a tool installer. He had written the Mac/Linux version as a <strong>bash</strong> script, and he needed the Windows version of the installer to be dead simple &mdash; the tool is currently messy and fiddly to install, and he wants to use it in a classroom situation and elsewhere, so the out-of-the-box install process must be non-obtrusive, otherwise people won&rsquo;t want to bother with it. I like making things simple and I&rsquo;m annoyed when they are stupidly difficult, so I decided to step up and help.</p>

<p>His initial thought was to make a Windows BAT file, but when I saw what he was trying to do I suggested that might produce too much hair pulling (James did write a support script with BAT and getting that to work wasted a lot of time). We briefly considered Visual Basic, which I&rsquo;ve had some experience with, but then I wondered if the tools for creating Windows .EXE files from Python might have progressed to the point of ease.</p>

<p>And indeed they have &mdash; PyInstaller worked the first time and every time. It has a <strong>&ndash;onefile</strong> flag to produce a single standalone executable with no support files. James was able to create a continuous-integration build for our project (on <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">Appveyor</a>), which fires every time we do a checkin and starts from a blank virtual machine on the cloud, loads all the necessary tools and builds everything, then runs tests.</p>

<p>One caveat: we were able to do everything using Python&rsquo;s &ldquo;batteries included&rdquo; libraries, so I haven&rsquo;t experimented with bringing in external libraries, but I don&rsquo;t expect problems there. They have a list of packages that they <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Supported-Packages">explicitly support</a>, and I suspect that ordinary Python libraries will work just fine.</p>

<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more! PyInstaller does this magic for different operating systems! Not just Windows, but Linux and Mac OSX. You can read more <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/#overview-what-pyinstaller-does-and-how-it-does-it">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="5-simplifying-configuration-and-format">5. Simplifying Configuration, and <code>format()</code></h2>

<p>Because James started with a <strong>bash</strong> script and he hasn&rsquo;t done a lot of bash programming, he followed the bad bash practice of using global variables all over the place, which you see as all uppercase identifiers. I took his script and translated it to Python which we then built into a Windows .EXE file.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reading <a href="https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/">Writing Idiomatic Python</a> which suggests using the <strong>format()</strong> function for string interpolation, so I gave it a try and quickly grew to like it. One thing that started to annoy me was passing it arguments; to use James&rsquo; global variables and keep it all consistent, I was writing things like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;My string with {THING_TO_SUBSTITUTE} in it&quot;.format(THING_TO_SUBSTITUTE=THING_TO_SUBSTITUTE)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I discovered that <strong>format()</strong> could take a dictionary and parse through it to find your particular arguments, and substitute those. So, if I put everything in a single dictionary, I could just pass that in to any <strong>format()</strong> like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;My string with {THING_TO_SUBSTITUTE} in it&quot;.format(**cf)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <strong>cf</strong> is the configuration dictionary.</p>

<p>(It turns out that I could also have left everything as global variables and passed <strong>**globals()</strong>).</p>

<p>This worked OK for awhile, but then I started to get bothered by having to write:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">cf[&quot;THING_TO_SUBSTITUTE&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>Everywhere. Too many characters, too noisy to write and read. What I wanted was the much simpler:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">cf.THING_TO_SUBSTITUTE
</code></pre>

<p>I discovered that by writing a quick subclass of <strong>dict</strong> I could accomplish this, and the results are:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import os, platform, pprint

class Configuration(dict):
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return self[attr]
    def __setattr__(self, attr, val):
        self[attr] = val

cf = Configuration(
    CLEANUP = os.getenv(&quot;LAUNCHER_CLEANUP&quot;),
    TRACE = os.getenv(&quot;LAUNCHER_TRACE&quot;),
    VERSION = None,
    RAW_VERSION = None,
    DOWNLOAD_PATH = None,
    HOST=&quot;something.org&quot;,
    DEFAULT_VERSION = &quot;0.10.33&quot;,
    OS = platform.system(),
    ARCHITECTURE = platform.architecture()[0], # 64bit or 32bit
    BASE_LOCAL_DIR = &quot;{APPDATA}\\launcher&quot;.format(APPDATA=os.getenv(&quot;APPDATA&quot;)),
    BIN = os.path.normpath(&quot;modules/bin/mod&quot;),
)

cf.RAW_VERSION = &quot;11.0.1&quot;

if cf.TRACE:
    pprint.pprint(cf)

print(&quot;host: {HOST}, OS: {OS}, arch: {ARCHITECTURE}&quot;.format(**cf))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that reading and writing the configuration variables is much nicer, and using them in a <strong>format()</strong> statement is quite elegant.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the output on one machine:</p>

<pre><code>c:\tmp&gt;set LAUNCHER_TRACE=1

c:\tmp&gt;python config.py
{'ARCHITECTURE': '32bit',
 'BASE_LOCAL_DIR': 'C:\\Users\\Bruce Eckel\\AppData\\Roaming\\launcher',
 'BIN': 'modules\\bin\\mod',
 'CLEANUP': None,
 'DEFAULT_VERSION': '0.10.33',
 'DOWNLOAD_PATH': None,
 'HOST': 'something.org',
 'OS': 'Windows',
 'RAW_VERSION': '11.0.1',
 'TRACE': '1 ',
 'VERSION': None}
host: something.org, OS: Windows, arch: 32bit
</code></pre>

<p>It might seem like a small thing, but I find that easier writing and reading of the code makes it worth it.</p>

<h2 id="6-pathlib-is-excellent">6. pathlib is Excellent</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made plenty of use of the <strong>os.path</strong> library. It&rsquo;s very helpful, but it isn&rsquo;t intuitive. The new <strong>pathlib</strong> which was added in Python 3.4 abstracts paths to the point where they are intuitive, which was no simple design feat.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple example which renames a group of files scattered throughout subdirectories:</p>

<pre><code>#! py -3
from pathlib import Path

for old in Path('.').glob(&quot;**/oldname.foo&quot;):
    old.rename(old.parent / &quot;newname.bar&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s the simplest solution to that problem that I&rsquo;ve seen. Note the use of <strong>&rsquo;/&rsquo;</strong> to combine parts of paths. I&rsquo;ve <em>always</em> wanted to do it that way.</p>
